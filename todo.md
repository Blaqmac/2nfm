**minimal todo**:

- [ ] figure out how to call init() inside of Streamer.vue from setDefaults & shareStreamUsingRTCMultiConnection (or refactor/communicate differently so no longer necessary?)
- [ ] test and see if RTCMultiConnection, adapter, & socket.io imports work correctly or need to be re-ordered / etc.
